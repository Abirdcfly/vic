# vSphere Integrated Containers - Architecture and Design

## Component Architecture

This is a component architecture for the system, encompassing some of the main control flows. It is intended to be used as a visual map for which components interact and how those interaction occur; it does not indicate what those interaction are. The diagram is an imagemap and clicking on a component, and some connectors, should take you to detail documents.
